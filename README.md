# CharlieCampbellA21-AcidRain

*************
- As if the zombiepocalyse wasnâ€™t bad enough, now you have to deal with acid rain. 
- Worse still, you have a condition that makes you feel the acid burn more than most folks, and your condition is getting worse every night. 
- Your only chance is to get the cure before it's too late. The Duke has it, but it will come at a cost.
- Goal: Complete up to five unique traders' missions to the tier level you agreed with the Duke (i.e. quest tiers 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5). Then, and only then, will he cure your pain.
- Collect clothing items along the way that offer some waterproofness. 
- When you complete each trader's quest tier, you'll receive an acid balm (which offers temporary acid rain invulnerability). 
- When you complete a quest tier up to the level agreed with the Duke, you'll also receive a hazmat item (which offers the best waterproofness).
- After a set number of days, the cure will be useless. Can you get it in time?
